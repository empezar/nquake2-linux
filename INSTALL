nQuake2 for Linux
=================
To install nQuake2, locate the installer tarball (nquake2vXX_installer-linux.tar.gz
where XX is a number) and extract it.


$ tar xvzf nquake2v10_installer-linux.tar.gz


Once you have extracted the package, change directory to the folder that was
created (same as the package but without .tar.gz), run the install script and
follow the instructions. You can use tab to auto-complete the folder name here
as well.


$ cd nquake2v10_installer-linux/
$ ./install_nquake.sh


After choosing what mirror to use for downloading, simply sit back and enjoy
a sweet cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice while nQuake2 downloads and
installs all the components needed to play Quake 2.

After installation has completed, start Quake 2 by changing directory to
where you chose to install nQuake2, and run q2pro.glx.


$ cd ~/nquake/
$ ./ezquake-gl.glx


If you are interested in playing the full Quake 2 game (singleplayer), you need
to buy Quake 2. From the Quake 2 installation, copy pak0.pak to ~/nquake2/baseq2/.

Thank you for downloading nQuake2
